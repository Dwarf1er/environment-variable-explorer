# Project Description

Environment Variable Explorer is a C# application designed to view, edit, add, and delete environment variables on your system, with support for different environment variable scopes (Process, User, Machine). It provides a clean and intuitive UI to help developers and sysadmins:

- Easily browse environment variables by target (Process, User, Machine).
- Edit values safely with undo/redo functionality.
- Add and delete variables, with platform-aware restrictions.

This tool is ideal for developers, administrators, and power users who want a simple way to manage environment variables without relying on command-line tools or registry editors. Whether debugging application configs or adjusting system-wide environment settings, Environment Variable Explorer streamlines the process.

No more hunting through OS settings or remembering complex commands! This app offers:

- ✅ Cross-platform support with platform-specific restrictions.
- ✅ Clear separation of environment variable targets.
- ✅ Safe editing with inline validation
- ✅ Quick access to environment variables for troubleshooting and configuration.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- 🔍 **Smart Filtering** - Browse variables by scope (Process/User/Machine)
- ✏️ **Inline Editing** - Click to edit with real-time validation
- ➕ **Easy Addition** - Add new variables with guided input
- 🗑️ **Safe Deletion** - Remove variables with confirmation prompts

### Platform Support
- 🪟 **Windows** - Full support for all variable scopes
- 🐧 **Linux/macOS** - Process-level variables only
- ⚡ **Cross-platform** - Built with .NET for maximum compatibility

## Understanding Environment Variable Targets

Environment variables can exist in different **scopes (or targets)** depending on your platform:

| Scope   | Description                                                                       | Windows Support | Linux/macOS Support              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Process | Available only to the current running application. **Temporary**.                 | ✅ Supported     | ✅ Supported                      |
| User    | Available to all applications run by the current user. Persisted in the registry. | ✅ Supported     | ⚠️ Not natively supported by .NET |
| Machine | Available system-wide for all users. Requires admin privileges.                   | ✅ Supported     | ⚠️ Not natively supported by .NET |

> [!WARNING]
> On **non-Windows platforms**, only **Process** scope is supported due to .NET limitations.
> We’re working on safe, platform-specific solutions to persist variables beyond process scope.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Dwarf1er/environment-variable-explorer/releases)
2. Download the latest version for your platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
3. Extract and run the executable

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dwarf1er/environment-variable-explorer.git
cd environment-variable-explorer
publish.sh # .\publish.ps1 on Windows
cd environment-variable-explorer/EnvironmentVariableExplorer/bin/Release/net9.0/{your-platform}/publish/
# run EnvironmentVariableExplorer binary
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch** the application
2. **Select scope** - Choose between Process, User, or Machine variables
3. **Browse** existing variables in the table
4. **Add new** variables using the "Add Variable" button
5. **Edit inline** by clicking any value cell
6. **Delete** by selecting a row and clicking the delete button

> [!NOTE]
> On non-Windows platforms, only Process-level variables can be modified. As of now, there are no persistent storage mechanisms

## Work in Progress / Roadmap 🚧

Here are some features and improvements we're actively working on:

- **🔄 Cross-platform Persistent Storage:**
  - Implementing a user-friendly solution to simulate persistent environment variables on **Linux/macOS**, such as:
    - Writing to `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`, or systemd environment files.
    - Using distro-specific methods (e.g., `~/.config/environment.d/` on systemd-based systems).

- **📤 Import/Export Options:**
  - Support for exporting environment variables to `.json` files.
  - Ability to import environment variable sets from `.json` files for sharing, quick setup or backup.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Registry Access Denied" when editing Machine variables**
- Run application as Administrator on Windows, Machine scopes require elevated permissions

**Variables not appearing**
- Switch to `All` scope in the drop-down and use full-text search to make sure your new variable was created in the correct scope
- `Process` environment variables are **temporary** and will be deleted after you stop the application
